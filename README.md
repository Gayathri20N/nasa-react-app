 NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) React App This project is a simple React web application that displays NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using the NASA APOD API. It fetches the daily image (or video), along with its title and explanation, and presents it with a modern UI. The app also features local caching to minimize API requests and includes a sidebar for additional information.
